User Management Dashboard
This React-based application provides functionality to manage users by displaying a list, adding new users, editing their details, and deleting them. It integrates with a mock API (JSONPlaceholder) for data handling.

Installation Instructions:
   - Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
   - Install the necessary dependencies by running:
        - npm install

Key Features:
   - Displays a user list with details including ID, name, email, and department.
   - Enables adding new users through a dedicated form.
   - Supports editing existing user details.
   - Allows deleting users (simulated, as JSONPlaceholder does not persist deletions).
   - Handles API requests with basic error management.

Technology Stack:
   - React for the frontend framework.
   - Axios for API communication.

Usage Instructions:
   - View user details in the displayed list.
   - Use the Add User button to open a form for creating a new user.
   - Click the Edit button to update details for an existing user.
   - Remove a user by clicking the Delete button (simulated functionality due to mock API limitations).

Important Notes:
   - JSONPlaceholder is a mock API that simulates responses for adding or deleting users, but changes are not permanently saved.

Potential Enhancements:
   - Add client-side form validation to improve user experience.
   - Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to handle larger datasets.
   - Make the UI responsive to ensure compatibility with mobile devices and varying screen sizes.
