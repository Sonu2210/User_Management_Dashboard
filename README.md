# User Management Dashboard

This React application allows you to view, add, edit, and delete users from a mock API (JSONPlaceholder).

## Installation

   npm install

   Features
Displays a list of users with details (ID, name, email, department).
Provides buttons for adding, editing, and deleting users.
Opens a user form for adding or editing user details.
Communicates with the JSONPlaceholder API for user data manipulation.
Includes basic error handling for API requests.
Technology Stack
React
Axios
Usage
View user details in the list.
Click "Add User" to create a new user.
Click "Edit" to modify an existing user's information.
Click "Delete" to remove a user (simulation, as JSONPlaceholder doesn't permanently delete).
Note
JSONPlaceholder simulates successful responses for adding and deleting users, but the changes aren't persisted.

Further Enhancements

Add pagination or infinite scrolling for large user lists.
Make the interface responsive for mobile and different screen sizes.
